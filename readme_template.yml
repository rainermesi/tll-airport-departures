# tll-airport-departures

Tracking departures from Tallinn Airport. Data and graphs are updated daily.

I created this repo to:
- Test how to use Mermaid charting functions for basic reporting
- Test how to use Github Actions for scheudling basic data pipelines and transformations
- Find out where we can fly to from Tallinn

## Trend of Daily Departures

Bars for total number of departures. Line for unique destinations.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "{title}"
    x-axis [{x_axis}]
    y-axis "{y_axis}" 0 --> {ymax}
    bar {bar_values}
    line {line_values}
```


## Unique destinations and departures

All destinations flown to from Tallinn. More departures = bigger node.
Note that umlauts don't seem to be supported in Mermaid Sankey Diagrams (experimental diagram).

```mermaid
---
config:
  sankey:
    showValues: false
    width: 800
    height: 1000
---
sankey-beta
%% source,target,value
{sankey_data}

```
